todo implement:

- better parallelism
- minimize hash
- serial optimization
- low level optimization (efficient assembly code that utilizes instruction
  set)
- gpu support with opencl! (both as gpu-only version and hybrid)
- good load balancing on hybrid cpu/gpu version
- autotuning of parameters
- hardcode good parameters

tentative roadmap

05: include parallelism, each thread works on separate sieve
06: improved parallelism, all threads works on the same sieve
