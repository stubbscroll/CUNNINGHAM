cunningham chains!

some small programs to find cunningham chains, each version will improve upon
the previous one

versions so far:

01 - find chains by stupid brute force
02 - use simple sieve to eliminate composite numbers with small prime factors
03 - multiply origin by primorial to increase number of primes in sieve
04 - use strategy that minimizes the number of primality tests

warning, external dependencies: gmp (gnu multiprecision library)
